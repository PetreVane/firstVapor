# First Vapor 

This is a template based on Paul Hudson's version of Vapor 3. Look for "Server-side swift Vapor Edition" book here: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/server-side-swift. 

This project contains few routes and few additional leaf files. It does nothing complicated other than showing some basic html pages. 
So this is just the result of trying out Vapor framework.

Unlike the official templates that are currently available, this template does not include vast swathes of extra example code that you will always need to delete. Instead, it adds just a single “hello” route so you can be sure everything is working correctly.

Although this repository contains a LICENSE file, this is meant for you to replace with whatever license you intend to use – please consider what little code is in this repository as public domain, and yours to do with as you please.

It’s my hope that the official Vapor project will add a template similar to this one at some point in the future, but until then please use this however you want.

## Try it out

If you have already installed the Vapor toolbox, you can create a new Vapor project from this repo using the following command:

    vapor new MyProject --template=twostraws/vapor-clean
